## Setup
1. Install the latest version of the required softwares.
2. Download the zip file, or clone the project from git repository.
3. Open command prompt in the project directory and install all dependencies and run the application.

`}`


 

## Features
List of features ready: 
* Administrator can add the records of both doctors and receptionists and assign them with login id and password. He can also, update or delete their records(if neccessary).
* Any receptionist of the hospital can register a patient on this application and make his appointment with the doctor which is available on the required date and time. 
* Every doctor can login in the software and can see all his upcoming appointments which are made by the receptionist. Any doctor can view only his appointment and not the appointments of the other doctors in the hospital.
* Similarly, each individual patient can also keep track of his upcoming appointment. 
* Doctor can fill in all the diagonosis details of the patient on this app which can be viewed later only by the respective patient by logging in. The doctor can also update this detail, after another checkup few months later.
* Whenever a login id is created for a person, he will automatically get an email mentioning his userid and password so that he can keep this for further use. 



To-do list:
* To extend this application  as a central software for administration of many hospitals at a time.
* To automatically delete the previous appointments or categorize them under archive section. 
* To restrict the health details to be updated only after the appointment date and only by the respective doctor.
* Payroll system can also be added in the project for all the employees of the hospital.
